# 🎧 Otodecks DJ Application

A fully-functional **DJ Mixing Application** built using C++ and JUCE Framework. Developed with a strong foundation in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, the app mimics the functionality of a real DJ console, allowing users to load, play, mix, and enhance tracks using custom user interface elements.
